    Designing a carbon project according to a methodology 
    
    The lifecycle of a carbon credit begins with project developers. Developers design and implement projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This may include projects focused on reforestation, renewable energy installations, methane capture, or sustainable agricultural practices. Each project must adhere to specific methodologies or protocols specific to a certain kind of carbon project that quantify the emissions reduction potential.
    
    Project developers then outline the project activities using a specific methodology in the Project Design Document (PDD). Internationally recognised methodologies/carbon certification standards include the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), the Gold Standard, the American Carbon Registry (ACR), and the Climate Action Reserve (CAR). DGB Group’s reforestation and afforestation projects are all verified using leading standards, such as the VCS and the Gold Standard, to ensure they deliver top-tier carbon credits and sustainable, positive results.
    </p1>
    <br>
    <p2> <h><b><u>Step 2: Project validation/verification </u></b></h><br>

        After project development, the project enters the validation/verification process. This ensures the legitimacy of the carbon credits generated by the project and involves two key parties: the third-party auditor and the third-party rating agency.
        Auditor
        
        An independent third-party auditor, known as the validation/verification body (VVB), assesses the project's emissions reduction claims by comparing project emissions to the baseline emissions. This step involves validating the project's baseline scenarios, monitoring processes, and methodologies for calculating emissions reductions. It consists of a desk review and field visit to confirm that the project meets the requirements of the carbon certification programme, like Verra’s VCS. The carbon certification standard must accept the VVB to process the project registration. 
        
        After successfully validating the project, the VVB issues a report and statement confirming compliance with the carbon certification standards that are used by the certifier to review the whole project. <br>
        Carbon rating agencies assess offsets' impact using various frameworks like BeZero's alphabetic scale (AAA, AA, A) or Sylvera's A to D scale. They rate the probability of the issued carbon credits achieving the targeted reductions, thereby ensuring the quality of the carbon credits. In general, a project must meet the following eligibility criteria: carbon score, additionality, and permanence. 
    </p2>
    <br>
    <p3>
        <h><u>The verification process</u></h>

        Verification ensures the project data’s integrity and compliance with carbon standards. Verifiers confirm project eligibility, monitor data accuracy, and validate emissions reduction calculations. This process can also involve site visits. After successful validation and verification, the project is now ready for registration. 
    </p3>
    <br>
    <p4>
        <h><b><u>Step 3: Carbon credit issuance</u></b> </h>

        Once the project has successfully passed the validation and verification process, the certifier can start issuing credits. Carbon credits issued can have various names, depending on where they are registered. Verified carbon credits under Verra’s VCS are called Verified Carbon Units (VCU); under the Gold Standard, they are called Verified Emission Reduction (VER). Each VCU/VER represents 1 tonne of carbon CO2e emissions and is assigned a unique serial number to be tracked across its life cycle in the project database. 
        
        The carbon registry keeps a record of who owns the carbon credit, who it is sold to, and when it’s retired. Once the project is verified, the carbon credits are issued based on the verified emission reductions to the project developer’s account and are then ready to be sold. This pivotal step marks the culmination of hard work, meticulous planning, and a commitment to mitigating emissions. Carbon credits can continue to be generated and issued for the crediting period, and the project remains subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting.
    </p4>
    <br>
    <p5>
        <h><b><u>Step 4: Sale/purchase of carbon credits</u></b></h>

        Carbon credits act as a currency in the carbon market. Once issued, they embark on a journey through the carbon market, finding their way to individuals, investors, businesses, and even governments looking to offset their emissions. The demand for carbon credits stems from regulatory compliance or voluntary decisions to meet climate and sustainability commitments.

        End buyers who want to reduce their carbon footprint or speculative investors can now buy these carbon credits on the market either directly or through brokers, traders, and exchanges. The registry then records this change of ownership. 
        
        The main carbon exchanges include the Carbon Trade Exchange (CTX), Xpansive, Toucan Protocol, AirCarbon Exchange (ACX), Climate Impact X (CIX), and Viridios AI. These exchanges provide a transparent and accessible marketplace for buyers and sellers, as well as daily and weekly carbon prices. They ensure the credibility of credits and enable easy access to carbon offset opportunities.

        <H><b><u>Step 5: Retirement of carbon credits</u></b></H>

        While carbon credits can be bought and sold like any other commodity, their ultimate purpose is to offset emissions. After a company decides to use a carbon credit to offset/reduce its carbon emissions, the carbon credit is retired. This means the registry cancels the carbon credit, and it is permanently taken out of circulation and cannot be traded or used for offsetting purposes anymore. Retirement ensures that the emissions reduction represented by the credit is not claimed by multiple parties, preventing double counting and maintaining the integrity of the carbon market. 
        
        Throughout the entire carbon credit lifecycle, transparency and accountability are essential. The credits must be thoroughly validated and verified to ensure they represent genuine emissions reductions. This integrity ensures that the carbon credit market effectively supports emissions reduction initiatives and helps combat climate change.
