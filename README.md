# Carbo Cred
Welcome to the Carbo Cred Marketplace! 

## Description
This platform creates awareness of carbon credits and how they can be sold.

## Introduction

Carbon credits are permits that allow the owner to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases (GHGs). One credit allows the emission of one ton of carbon dioxide or the equivalent of other greenhouse gases. Carbon credits are also known as carbon offsets.

The marketplace empowers individuals and company owners to monetize their renewable energy contributions by selling carbon credits. By participating, this way they help reduce global CO2 emissions and support sustainable energy solutions.

Carbo Cred will always act as a link/ intermidiate  between the sub-seller/seller

## Features

- **Estimate Carbon Credits:** Calculate the carbon emissions reduced by individuals and companies.
- **Verification and Certification:** Ensures that companies or individuals who are emmitting CO2 gasses are verified, and can only release upto a certain amount of it to the environment.
- **Marketplace for Selling Carbon Credits:** Connect with buyers looking to offset their carbon footprint.

## How It Works

### Estimating Carbon Credits

1. **Collect Data:** Provide information about those using solar panels, records about tree planting and existing trees that help absorb the CO2 in the environment.
2. **Calculate Emissions Reduction:** Use the collected data to determine the amount of CO2 emissions reduced.
   - Formula: 
     \[
     \text{Emissions Reduction (kg CO2)} = \text{Energy Produced (kWh)} \times \text{Emission Factor (kg CO2/kWh)}
     \]
3. **Standardize Calculations:** Ensure calculations align with recognized carbon credit standards.

### Verification and Certification

1. **Engage a Verification Body:** Partner with organizations such as SGS, DNV GL, TÜV SÜD, The Gold Standard Foundation, or Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) for verification.
2. **Prepare for Verification:** Collect necessary documentation and data, including installation records and energy production data.
3. **Undergo Verification:** The verification body will audit and verify the data.
4. **Certification:** Verified emissions reductions are certified, confirming their validity.

### Facilitating the Sale of Carbon Credits

1. **Create a Platform:** Register your details, submit the data, and apply for verification and certification.
2. **Educate and Support:** Access resources and support throughout the process.
3. **Connect with Buyers:** Engage with companies and individuals interested in buying carbon credits.
4. **Market and Promote:** Attract both sellers and buyers by highlighting the benefits of participating in the marketplace.
